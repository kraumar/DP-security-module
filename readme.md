Install `node`

Go to folder where `server.js` is and type

```sh
$ npm install
```

If you run `node ./server.js` your browser should automatically open up to `http://localhost:3000` index.html from public folder.

If you want to test, for instance `select * ...` just type in your browser search bar `http://localhost:3000/getall` and check your console log
